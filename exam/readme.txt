Note: We are interested in the reasoning underlying the solution, as opposed to simply the answer. Thus, solutions with the correct answer but without adequate explanation will not receive full credit; on the other
hand, partial solutions with explanation will receive partial credit. Within a given problem, you can assume the results of previous parts in proving later parts (e.g., it is fine to solve part 3) first, assuming the results of parts 1) and 2)).
